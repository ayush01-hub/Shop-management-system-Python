## Shop Management System using Python
We will build this project using the Tkinter and MySQL Connector modules in Python. We use the MySQL Connector to store the details in a table and access them. Using this we will build GUI where the user gets to do the following:

1. Add a product
2. Delete a product
3. View all products
4. Generate a bill and store it in a database
